### Hi, I'm William! 👋
### CS Junior @ OSU | 🏆 CS 290 Hall of Fame Inductee

I’m a Computer Science student at Oregon State University, but at heart, I’m a problem solver for the communities I love.

My journey into software engineering started with a simple frustration: I wanted better tools for the rhythm games I played. That curiosity led to the creation of the Robeats Community Server because the original Robeats didn't have hard enough songs and I wanted to port charts from osu!mania over to ROBLOX; this led to exposure to a whole new genre of a game to ROBLOX. Nowadays, my work focuses on tools for the game *Pump It Up*, which can be seen in the *Tournament Builder* project.

When I'm not engineering, you can usually find me consuming my pasttime hobbies: 
Going on DMOJ and solving archived coding problems
Playing high-stamina doubles on *Pump It Up*
Doing landscape photography.

**Ask me about:** Rhythm games, finding the perfect keyboard switch, or what kind of genetics are ideal for rhythm games (I have an uncanny curiosity about this...)
