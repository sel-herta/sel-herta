### Hi, I'm William! 👋
### CS Junior @ OSU | 🏆 CS 290 Hall of Fame Inductee

I’m a Computer Science student at Oregon State University, but at heart, I’m a problem solver for the communities I love.

My journey into software engineering started with a simple frustration: I wanted better tools for the rhythm games I played. That curiosity led to the creation of the **Robeats Community Server** because the original game lacked difficulty; I wanted to port charts from *osu!mania*, which ultimately introduced a whole new genre of rhythm gameplay to the Roblox ecosystem. It also indirectly led to the making of some of the best players this genre of game has seen today! Nowadays, my work focuses on tools for the game *Pump It Up*, seen in the **Tournament Builder** project.

When I'm not engineering, you can usually find me:
* 🧩 **Solving Algorithms:** Grinding archived coding problems on DMOJ. [Profile](https://dmoj.ca/user/CrzHerta)
* 🏃‍♂️ **Playing Rhythm Games:** Training intense-stamina doubles on *Pump It Up/ITG*. [clip](https://youtube.com/shorts/3QNvQVckiqA?si=FMdpedM1ub9z6ihQ)
* 📸 **Photography:** capturing landscape photography.

**Ask me about:** Rhythm games, finding the perfect keyboard switch, what kind of genetics are ideal for rhythm games (I have an uncanny curiosity about this...), or anything Herta from Honkai: Star Rail
